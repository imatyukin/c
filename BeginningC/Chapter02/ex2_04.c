// Exercise 2-4.
// Write a program that prompts for the userâ€™s weekly pay in dollars and the hours worked to be entered through the
// keyboard as floating-point values. The program should then calculate and output the average pay per hour in the
// following form:
// Your average hourly pay rate is 7 dollars and 54 cents.
