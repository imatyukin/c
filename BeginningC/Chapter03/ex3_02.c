// Exercise 3-2.
// Write a program that prompts the user to enter the date as three integer values for the month, the day in the month,
// and the year. The program should then output the date in the form 31st December 2003 when the user enters 12 31 2003,
// for example.
// You will need to work out when th, nd, st, and rd need to be appended to the day value. Donâ€™t forget 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
// 4th; but 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th; and 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and 24th.
